# My First Shopify App!

After missing out on the Shopify dev intern applications last year, I was not going to miss out on it this year for sureâ€¦ Well until I almost did, except not really. I was just reminded on approximately the 23th of August that the applications were closing September 8th @ 9:00 am. After frantically reading the application, I realized that I had some work to do and I needed to start a project ASAP. I had been meaning to make an app all summer while working as a Junior Support Advisor, looks like this will be my chance to do so! And to be perfectly honest this is my first solo, self-taught dev project! So let us dive on in!
